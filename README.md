# Comic Reader

An installable, offline-first web reader for local CBZ comic libraries.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local address shown in the terminal. The application currently contains the first interface milestone with representative library data.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## GitHub Pages

The repository is configured for the URL:

```text
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/comic-reader/
```

In the GitHub repository, open **Settings → Pages** and select **GitHub Actions** as the source. Pushing to `main` will run the included deployment workflow.

If you rename the repository, update `base`, `start_url`, and `scope` in `vite.config.ts`.

## Planned milestones

1. Application shell and PWA deployment
2. Read-only local folder selection
3. Library scanning and natural sorting
4. CBZ extraction and vertical reading
5. Seamless chapter transitions
6. Reading progress and preferences
